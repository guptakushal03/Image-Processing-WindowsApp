# Image Processing Windows Application

## Overview
The **Image Processing Windows Application** is a desktop software built using **Visual Studio 2019, VB, and Emgu CV 4.5**. This application provides various image processing functionalities, including **grayscale conversion, binarization, edge detection, morphological operations, face/eye detection, QR code generation/detection, OCR, and COVID-19-result-related processing**.

## Features
- **Basic Image Processing:**
  - Grayscale conversion
  - Binarization (Thresholding)
  - Contour detection
- **Morphological Processing:**
  - Dilation
  - Erosion
  - Opening & Closing
  - Gradiant
  - Top Hat & Black Hat
- **Object Detection:**
  - Face & Eye detection
  - QR Code detection & generation
  - Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
- **Advanced Features:**
  - COVID-19 related processing
  
## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Visual Basic (VB)
- **IDE:** Visual Studio 2019
- **Library:** Emgu CV 4.5 (OpenCV wrapper for .NET)
- **Framework:** .NET Framework

## Installation
### Prerequisites
1. **Windows OS** (Compatible with Windows 10 and later)
2. **Visual Studio 2019** (with .NET Framework support)
3. **Emgu CV 4.5**

## Usage Instructions
1. Launch the application.
2. Load an image from **File > Open Image**.
3. Select processing operations from the **Edit, Morphological Processing, or Detection** menus.
4. View real-time changes and save processed images as needed.

## Future Improvements
- Adding **deep learning-based object detection**.
- Optimizing **real-time video processing**.
- Enhancing **GUI design** for better user experience.
- Implementing **cloud-based image processing**.
